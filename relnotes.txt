                   Mentor Embedded Inflexion UI Runtime for Any OS

                           *** Release History ***

*******************************************************************************
Release 2.6.0                                                    February, 2013
*******************************************************************************

INTEGRATION ISSUES

* The runtime configuation file has been cleaned up and moved to a consistent
location.  For convenience, the old configuration file (engine/config/ifxui_cfg.h)
is retained, but points to the new configuration file (ifxui_config.h).

* The Inflexion runtime is no longer compatible with v2.4 or earlier themes.
Please import old themes in UI Express v 2.6.0 or later to upgrade themes (but
note that themes using graphic type elements whose resource string indirectly
links to a .dae COLLADA file will need to be manually set to use anti-aliasing).

* Due to the fix to dts0100902414, plugin elements must now indicate whether
their image data has pre-multiplied alpha or not. If so, set the property
member hasPreMultipliedAlpha to 1 in the call to CreateElement.

* Due to the fix to dts0100873483, existing Java module implementations that
use plugin elements will need to add a ‘IfxRenderContext pContext’ parameter
to the public int paintElement() method.

* Support for splitting textures into a grid which may be deformed in a vertex
shader means that any existing shader that moved vertices before the 
modelview calculation may not work with v2.5 until it has been updated.

* The mechanism by which 'placeholder' data is used in menus when in 'load on
demand' mode has been revised to support components (even menu components)
being used as menu items.  The existing placeholder api call to modules has
been deprecated, and will no longer be called by the runtime.  Themes that
wish to use the placeholder feature should make use of the '_placeholderActive'
intrinsic variable in layout, data source or resource expressions.

KNOWN ISSUES
* When importing and building the Android projects in Eclipse under the Android SDK,
the following warning will be generated by Android ADT for each product:
"minSdkVersion (3) is lower than the project target API level (8)"
This warning is benign, and may be ignored

* When importing and building the Android projects in Eclipse under the Android SDK,
the following warning will be generated by the Java compiler for the photopicker demo:
"The import java.nio.ByteBuffer is never used"
This warning is benign, and may be ignored

* When importing and building the Android projects in Eclipse under the Android SDK,
the following warning will be generated by the NDK compiler for the photopicker
and homescreen demos:
"C:/Android/android-ndk-r6b/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.4.3/prebuilt/
windows/bin/../lib/gcc/arm-linux-androideabi/4.4.3/../../../../
arm-linux-androideabi/bin/ld.exe: warning: C:/Android/android-ndk-r6b/toolchains
/arm-linux-androideabi-4.4.3/prebuilt/windows/bin/../lib/gcc/
arm-linux-androideabi/4.4.3/libgcc.a(unwind-arm.o) uses 4-byte wchar_t yet the 
output is to use 2-byte wchar_t; use of wchar_t values across objects may fail"
This warning is benign, and may be ignored

* When importing and building the Android projects in Eclipse 3.5 under the Android SDK,
the following warnings will be generated by the Java compiler for the photopicker demo:
"Unnecessary @SuppressWarnings("unused")   BaseImageList.java,line 214"
This warning is benign, and may be ignored

* When importing and building the Android projects in Eclipse 3.5 under the Android SDK,
the following warnings will be generated by the Java compiler for the InflexionUIRuntime
project:
"The method getInflexionWidth(int) from the type IfxFramework is never used locally      
IfxFramework.java,line 1067"
This warning is benign, and may be ignored

NEW FEATURES

* Support for 'right to left' languages (e.g. Arabic, Hebrew)

* Improved efficiency when handling COLLADA files

* Support for COLLADA files created with Blender 2.5

* Support for displacements applied during a 'mouseover' event (for devices supporting
mouse input)

* Support for non-string data types in static menu files

* Ability to turn off scene lighting on a per-element basis

* New porting layer methods IFXP_Check_GL_Extension, IFXP_Image_Check_Extension
used to check for Open GL ES extension support and Image file decoding support
respectively

* Some simple string formatting operators are supported, allowing non-string data to
be used within text element resource expressions in a more useful manner.  Please
consult the UI Express documentation for more details

* Anti-aliasing on Open GL devices may be enabled on a per-element basis.  Previously
anti-aliasing was always enabled for 3-d meshes only.

* Whole-scene dithering on Open GL devices is now automatically used when the device
display is 16 BPP - dithering should not be applied at the UI Express packaging step
in this situation.

* Support in Android for translucent applications (e.g. support for live wallpaper etc).

* Support for vertical and horizontal text marquee

* Support for use of system fonts if primary font can't render all glyphs in a text
string

FIXES AND OPTIMIZATIONS
The following optimizations have been applied in this release:

* On Open GL ES 2.0 devices (and where the GPU drivers support the GL_OES_get_program_binary
extension) binary shader objects are cached if possible and subsequently used instead
of the shader source files.  This speeds up start-up time of a device not using
pre-compiled shaders dramatically (after the first time).

* Use of repeated mesh geometries within a COLLADA file is now handled much more
efficiently.

* Opening a menu component using the same URI resource string as used by an already
created menu component will not result in a new instance of the data source being
created.  This will speed up certain themes currently using multiple copies of dynamic
data sets.

*******************************************************************************
Release 2.4                                                       October, 2011
*******************************************************************************

INTEGRATION ISSUES
* Due to the fix for “dts0100781280: Text extent is not obeyed sometimes”, the
selection of the appropriate font size for a given font and text element extent
height has changed in the case of “native” (in other words, Freetype-rendered)
fonts. In general, native fonts will be a little smaller, so themes to be used
with this runtime upgrade should be reviewed carefully to ensure that the theme
text is still readable and is acceptably laid out.

* Due to the fix for “dts0100769554 - Linux / Android porting layers shouldn't
use 'gettimeofday'”, there is now a runtime dependency on the function 
clock_gettime within libinflexionui.so. Any existing Linux projects will need to
add '-lrt' to the LDFLAGS variable in the Makefile.

* The runtime engine can now optimize drawing in Open GL ES rendering mode based
on whether images contain any transparency data or not.  Existing module
implementations that have elements that are drawn to screen should set the
translucency member of the IFX_ELEMENT_PROPERTY structure to
IFX_TRANSLUCENCY_ELEMENT_NONOPAQUE if the element buffer typically contains
transparent pixels (i.e. appears non-rectangular on the screen).

KNOWN ISSUES
* When importing and building the Android projects in Eclipse under the Android SDK,
the following warning will be generated by Android ADT for each product:
"minSdkVersion (3) is lower than the project target API level (8)"
This warning is benign, and may be ignored

* When importing and building the Android projects in Eclipse under the Android SDK,
the following warning will be generated by the Java compiler for the photopicker demo:
"The import java.nio.ByteBuffer is never used"
This warning is benign, and may be ignored

* When importing and building the Android projects in Eclipse under the Android SDK,
the following warning will be generated by the NDK compiler for the photopicker

This warning is benign, and may be ignored

NEW FEATURES

* None

FIXES AND OPTIMIZATIONS

Release 2.3                                                      March 31, 2011
*******************************************************************************

INTEGRATION ISSUES
Release 2.3 has a revised folder structure that differs significantly from release
2.1.  The application framework has also changed slightly, and old applications
will need to match the new framework API.

Android Applications created with version 2.1 will need the following changes:

 - the file <project folder>/Android.mk has incorrect paths to the framework
   source files.  Please change the following lines:
       LOCAL_SRC_FILES += \
           ../inflexionui/porting/android/src/ifxui_framework_native.cpp  \
           ../inflexionui/porting/android/src/ifxui_client_interface.cpp  \

   to
       LOCAL_SRC_FILES += \
           ../inflexionui/framework/src/ifxui_framework_native.cpp  \
           ../inflexionui/framework/src/ifxui_client_interface.cpp  \

   and
       LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../inflexionui/engine/config/android
       LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../inflexionui/porting/android/inc
       ...
       LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../inflexionui/modules/android/status
   to
       LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../inflexionui/engine/config
       LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../inflexionui/framework/inc
       ...
       LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += $(LOCAL_PATH)/../inflexionui/modules/status

 - the file containing the class implementation that extends 
   com.mentorgraphics.inflexionui.IfxFramework must have the following method
   added:
       @Override
          protected int getIfxMsaaSamples() {
              return 0;
          }

 - the file <project folder>/android.application MAY have a wrong path to the 
   ifxui_status.module file if that was added to the application definition
   file:
       ..\inflexionui\modules\android\status
   should be
       ..\inflexionui\modules\status


KNOWN ISSUES
* When importing the Android project files into Eclipse (assuming the Android SDK
and NDK have been also installed) the shared library and demo projects will build
automatically.  Sometimes the shared library in <demo project folder>/libs/armeabi
is not created, in which case the demo app will not run correctly.  If this occurs,
please 'refresh' the affected project in Eclipse and the problem will be resolved.

* When importing and building the Android projects in Eclipse under the Android SDK,
the following warning will be generated by Android ADT for each product:
"minSdkVersion (3) is lower than the project target API level (8)"
This warning is benign, and may be ignored

* When importing and building the Android projects in Eclipse under the Android SDK,
the following warning will be generated by the Java compiler for the photopicker demo:
"The import java.nio.ByteBuffer is never used"
This warning is benign, and may be ignored

* When importing and building the Android projects in Eclipse 3.5 under the Android SDK,
the following warnings will be generated by the Java compiler for the photopicker demo:
"Unnecessary @SuppressWarnings("unused")   BaseImageList.java,line 214"
This warning is benign, and may be ignored

* When importing and building the Android projects in Eclipse 3.5 under the Android SDK,
the following warnings will be generated by the Java compiler for the InflexionUIRuntime
project:
"The method getInflexionWidth(int) from the type IfxFramework is never used locally      
IfxFramework.java,line 1067"
This warning is benign, and may be ignored

NEW FEATURES

* The folder structure installed by the Inflexion UI Runtime installer has been
revised to simplify use by the customer.  There are now 'Android' and 'Linux'
folders containing all relevant files for the chosen operating system.

*******************************************************************************

INTEGRATION ISSUES
* Release 2.0 is not backwards compatible with previous applications or themes.
Existing module implementations will have to use the bundled integrator tool 
to regenerate module headers and integration layers.
Existing 2.0-compatible themes should be imported into the 2.1 UI Express tool,
where the project update wizard will perform the necessary changes.

* Product deliverables have been re-organized:
opengles has moved from inflexionui/utilities/opengles to 
inflexionui/porting/common/opengles
Android stlport has moved from inflexionui/utilities/android/stlport to
inflexionui/porting/android/stlport
simpleedit module has moved from inflexionui/modules/simpleedit to 
inflexionui/modules/common/simpleedit
Android status module has moved from inflexionui/modules/status to
inflexionui/modules/android/status
Linux multimedia module has moved from inflexionui/modules/multimedia to
inflexionui/modules/linux/multimedia

* Nucleus OS support has been removed - for Nucleus OS support, please contact
embedded_support@mentor.com and ask about the Mentor Embedded Nucleus ReadyStart
product

KNOWN ISSUES

* The freetype component will generate the following warnings when built with most tools:
    "src\autofit\afhints.c", line 642: Warning:  #550-D: variable "first" was set but never used
    "src\cff\cffparse.c", line 166: Warning:  #550-D: variable "rest" was set but never used
These 'warnings' are benign, and can be safely ignored.

*******************************************************************************
Release 2.0                                                  September 16, 2010
*******************************************************************************

INTEGRATION ISSUES
* Release 2.0 is not backwards compatible with previous UI Themes or
applications.  Existing module implementations will have to update the module
definition file and use the bundled integrator tool to regenerate module headers
and integration layers.
* The 'platform definition file' from previous versions is obsolete - please see
the 'application definition file' and 'device definition file' sections in the
user guide.
* The IFXC API is no longer supported

KNOWN ISSUES

* If using EDGE ARM Compilation Tools, version 2.2 or later must be used.
Earlier versions are not compatible.  If you do not have EACT 2.2 or later,
please download it from http://supportnet.mentor.com/.

* If using CodeSourcery Compilation Tools 3.4.2 in Edge 2.2, the following environment
variables need to be set in the toolset settings ('Windows->Preferences...', then
'Edge->Build->Tools Configuration'.  Select CodeSourcery ARM GNU Tools):
   set CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=%GNU_HOME%\include\c++\3.4.2\arm-none-eabi;%GNU_HOME%\include\c++\3.4.2;%C_INCLUDE_PATH%
   set LIB_PATH=%TOOLS_HOME%\lib\gcc\arm-none-eabi\3.4.2

* If using Microtec PPC or ColdFire compilation tools (any version), some additional
integration effort will be required to connect modules to the Inflexion UI Engine:
due to differences in the expansion of wide-char string literals in C and C++ code under
these toolsets, string comparison and manipulation functions will not work as expected.
It is recommended that the integration layer (as generated by the Integrator tool) and
the module interface implementations for the header files (also generated by the Integrator
tool) be compiled as C++ code, with the interface to any native functionality written in C
manually created as a shim layer that can convert any necessary string parameters between
wide and narrow char representations as required

* The freetype component will generate the following warnings when built with most tools:
    "src\autofit\afhints.c", line 642: Warning:  #550-D: variable "first" was set but never used
    "src\cff\cffparse.c", line 166: Warning:  #550-D: variable "rest" was set but never used
These 'warnings' are benign, and can be safely ignored.


NEW FEATURES

* Completely new 'condition' based layout system
* Support for reusable UI components
* Support for UI pages without menus
* Support for Open GL ES 2.0 and programmable shader effects (required Open GL ES 2.0 drivers)
* Support for Java language modules for Android OS
* X86 linux-compatible UIIntegrator tool
* Revised framework for Android Activity integration, including Eclipse IDE plugin


FIXES AND OPTIMIZATIONS

The following fixes and optimizations have been applied in this release:-

* Defect dts0100586861: The default extent used is too small, If a mesh origin is not at the mesh bounding
box center and there is no extent or extent hint,

* Defect dts0100592811: Handle meshes over 65535 vertices

Release 1.7                                                     March 15, 2010
*******************************************************************************
This is a minor release of the product. The purpose of
this release is to make changes required due to re-branding of
Nucleus Graphics to Inflexion UI.

INTEGRATION ISSUES
* Existing porting layers for versions 1.6 and before will need updating before 
being compatible with Inflexion UI 1.7:
   1) Following the fix for defect dts0100603187, the following functions have
      a changed function signature:
      IFXE_Process_Timers
      IFXP_Timer_Schedule
      IFXP_Timer_Get_Current_Time
      In all cases, the 'time' parameter has been split into 'upper' and 'lower'
      DWORDs so that the system time can be 64 bit.

* Existing applications for versions 1.5 and before will need updating before 
being compatible with Inflexion UI 1.7:
   1) If the application includes the headers ifxui_cfg.h, ifxui_porting.h,
      ifxui_framework_<os name>.h or ifxui_control.h the following paths will need
      adding to the compiler command line (or the paths in the include statement
      updating) as necessary
      -I../../../inflexionui/engine/config/<os name>
      -I../../../inflexionui/porting/<os name>/inc

   2)If the application uses 'Buffered' mode plugin elements, then following the
     fix for defect dts0100618613 if there is no 'extentHint' on a plugin element
     in the classes section of the template the module MUST specify the buffer
     size by setting the values of requiredBufferWidth and requiredBufferHeight
     of the IFX_ELEMENT_PROPERTY structure passed into the call to
     'IFXM - ChangeElementMode'.

KNOWN ISSUES

* If using EDGE ARM Compilation Tools, version 2.2 or later must be used.
Earlier versions are not compatible.  If you do not have EACT 2.2 or later,
please download it from http://supportnet.mentor.com/.

* If using CodeSourcery Compilation Tools 3.4.2 in Edge 2.2, the following environment
variables need to be set in the toolset settings ('Windows->Preferences...', then
'Edge->Build->Tools Configuration'.  Select CodeSourcery ARM GNU Tools):
   set CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=%GNU_HOME%\include\c++\3.4.2\arm-none-eabi;%GNU_HOME%\include\c++\3.4.2;%C_INCLUDE_PATH%
   set LIB_PATH=%TOOLS_HOME%\lib\gcc\arm-none-eabi\3.4.2

* If using Microtec PPC or ColdFire compilation tools (any version), some additional
integration effort will be required to connect modules to the Inflexion UI Engine:
due to differences in the expansion of wide-char string literals in C and C++ code under
these toolsets, string comparison and manipulation functions will not work as expected.
It is recommended that the integration layer (as generated by the Integrator tool) and
the module interface implementations for the header files (also generated by the Integrator
tool) be compiled as C++ code, with the interface to any native functionality written in C
manually created as a shim layer that can convert any necessary string parameters between
wide and narrow char representations as required

* The freetype component will generate the following warnings when built with RVCT3.1/4.0:
    "src\autofit\afhints.c", line 642: Warning:  #550-D: variable "first" was set but never used
    "src\cff\cffparse.c", line 166: Warning:  #550-D: variable "rest" was set but never used
These 'warnings' are benign, and can be safely ignored.

* IFX_RENDER_BUFFERED_OPENGL mode is not supported in this release.

NEW FEATURES

* Re-branding.  This product is now known as Mentor Embedded Inflexion UI for Any OS

FIXES AND OPTIMIZATIONS

The following fix has been applied in this release:-

* Defect dts0100603187: Engine timer event list assumes an ever-increasing time value, but 
timer is an unsigned int

     fix for defect dts0100618613 if there is no 'extentHint' on a plugin element
     in the classes section of the template the module MUST specify the buffer
     size by setting the values of requiredBufferWidth and requiredBufferHeight
     of the IFX_ELEMENT_PROPERTY structure passed into the call to
     'IFXM - ChangeElementMode'.

KNOWN ISSUES

* If using EDGE ARM Compilation Tools, version 2.2 or later must be used.
Earlier versions are not compatible.  If you do not have EACT 2.2 or later,
please download it from http://supportnet.mentor.com/.

* If using CodeSourcery Compilation Tools 3.4.2 in Edge 2.2, the following environment
variables need to be set in the toolset settings ('Windows->Preferences...', then
'Edge->Build->Tools Configuration'.  Select CodeSourcery ARM GNU Tools):
   set CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=%GNU_HOME%\include\c++\3.4.2\arm-none-eabi;%GNU_HOME%\include\c++\3.4.2;%C_INCLUDE_PATH%
   set LIB_PATH=%TOOLS_HOME%\lib\gcc\arm-none-eabi\3.4.2

* If using Microtec PPC or ColdFire compilation tools (any version), some additional
integration effort will be required to connect modules to the Inflexion UI Engine:
due to differences in the expansion of wide-char string literals in C and C++ code under
these toolsets, string comparison and manipulation functions will not work as expected.
It is recommended that the integration layer (as generated by the Integrator tool) and
the module interface implementations for the header files (also generated by the Integrator
tool) be compiled as C++ code, with the interface to any native functionality written in C
manually created as a shim layer that can convert any necessary string parameters between
wide and narrow char representations as required

* The freetype component will generate the following warnings when built with RVCT3.1/4.0:
    "src\autofit\afhints.c", line 642: Warning:  #550-D: variable "first" was set but never used
    "src\cff\cffparse.c", line 166: Warning:  #550-D: variable "rest" was set but never used
These 'warnings' are benign, and can be safely ignored.

* IFX_RENDER_BUFFERED_OPENGL mode is not supported in this release.

Nucleus Graphics for Any OS
